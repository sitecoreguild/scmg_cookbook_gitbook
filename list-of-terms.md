When working with a recipe there may be some terms and concepts that are new to you. These section will list out some of those terms to help you understand what is being discussed.

\*** WARNING: THIS IS STILL VERY ROUGH SO PLEASE BE PATIENT AND LET US KNOW ANY PLACES WE ARE MISSING DETAILS OR IF THERE IS A BETTER WAY OF EXPLAINING THE CONCEPT OR TERM \***

A lot of the definitions taken right now are in the official commerce documentation for now but we are going to be pulling from all sorts of sources.

The key is the definition should be self contained in the document and not include any links outside.  This will make it easy for anyone to download the PDF version and go.
