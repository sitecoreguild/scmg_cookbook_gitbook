Given the power and complexity of Sitecore Commerce, it is often difficult to find out the information you require to perform a specific task or get started on developing something without going to many places.  This cookbook aims to provide recipes for you to perform those tasks such as creating a price book, renaming a site, or getting proper requirements from a customer.

This book will only be as powerful as its contributors so the more recipes submitted the more the whole community will benefit. We look forward to building this together.  

This book contains complete recipes. It may contain links to resources but all the steps will be local to the recipe.  If you have links to articles you wish to share please add them to the Sitecore Commerce Mentoring Guild book.
